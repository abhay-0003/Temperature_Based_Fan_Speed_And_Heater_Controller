# Temperature_Based_Fan_Speed_And_Heater_Controller
Welcome to ny project on **Temperature_Based_Fan_Speed_And_Heater_Controller**. This project demonstrates a system that adjusts fan speed & heater based on temperature changes using a thermistor, an op-amp (IC741), a relay switch, and an AC voltage capacitor. This setup ensures efficient cooling tailored to environmental conditions.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to utilize a thermistor for accurate temperature measurement, which then influences the speed of a fan through a control circuit. This setup mimics real-world applications where automatic temperature regulation is crucial for maintaining comfort and efficiency.

## Key Components Used

- **Thermistor**: Measures temperature accurately.
- **Op-amp (IC741)**: Processes the temperature data and drives the control circuit.
- **Relay Switch**: Controls the fan speed based on temperature readings.
- **AC Voltage Capacitor**: Ensures stable operation of the control circuit.

- ## How to Use

To replicate or utilize our project:
1. **Circuit Assembly**: Connect the components (thermistor, op-amp, relay switch, AC voltage capacitor) as per the provided circuit diagram.
2. **Power Supply**: Ensure the circuit is powered correctly.
3. **Temperature Measurement**: Position the thermistor in the environment where temperature monitoring is required.
4. **Operation**: Observe how the fan speed adjusts based on temperature variations.

## Output

Temperature Ranges: 
Below 18℃ : Heater On 
18 - 30℃ : Fan speed low 
30 - 35℃ : Fan speed Medium
